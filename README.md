This is just a "app" created in Python to check the Weather in any local of the world using the https://openweathermap.org/api, the project it's in the final of the training video from the Youtube Channel BroCode (my goat). I only did it to study purposes to learn python and it's a plain and simple project using an API.
Required libraries:
1. requests
2. PyQt5
